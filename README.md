## Context

Docker is a platform that allows you to containerize your applications, meaning that you can package them into portable, self-contained environments that can run anywhere. This allows you to quickly move your application from one environment to another, such as from your local computer to a server, without worrying about dependencies or configuration issues. Docker achieves this by using containers, which are isolated environments that contain everything an application needs to run, such as libraries, dependencies, and configurations. Docker containers are lightweight and can be started and stopped quickly, making them ideal for modern software development and deployment. 

With Docker, you can also quickly scale your application by running multiple containers of the same application on different hosts (or the same host, as we will do in this project), and manage them using Docker Compose or other orchestration tools.

Ultimately, what you will create in this project is an infrastructure for an application that utilizes a reverse proxy, a load balancer, two application servers, and one front-end server.

## High-level Design

In this design, there is a single server that acts as the entry point for your application. That server acts as a reverse proxy server, which routes traffic to either the API servers or the front-end static-content server; it also acts as a load balancer to balance traffic between the two API servers. When traffic comes in, the server will determine which service it needs to go to (either the front-end static-content server or the API server) and:

- **If the request is to be routed to the front-end static-content server**, it will do so, and any static content that is returned from the front-end static-content server to the proxy server will then be sent to the client. The client isn’t directly communicating with the front-end static-content server.

- **If the request is to be routed to the API server**, then it will first go through a load-balancing algorithm to determine which API server to send the request to. We will be using the basic Round Robin load-balancing algorithm for our site. Once the request is routed to an API server and the response is sent back to the proxy server, it will then be sent to the client. The client isn’t directly communicating with either of the API servers.

### What is Round Robin Load Balancing?

Round Robin load balancing is a method of distributing traffic across multiple servers or nodes in a network. In this approach, the load balancer assigns requests to each server in a rotating manner, meaning that each server takes turns serving the requests. 

For example, if there are three servers A, B, and C:
- The first request will be sent to server A.
- The second to server B.
- The third to server C.
- The fourth to A, the fifth to B, and so on.

This cycle repeats, ensuring that each server receives an equal share of the traffic and prevents any one server from becoming overwhelmed with requests. Round Robin load balancing is a simple and effective way to distribute traffic, but it may not be suitable for all applications, particularly those with varying workload patterns or resource requirements. For our learning purposes in this project, it is a sufficient algorithm to implement for our load-balancing needs.

## What You Need Before Starting

1. **Install Docker Desktop on your local computer (not your sandbox):**
   - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
   - For more detailed installation instructions, see:
     - [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
     - [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
     - [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
     - **Chromebook** - Note: This is the Docker engine, but not Docker Desktop. It is unclear how well this will work on a Chromebook—you may want to use a Windows, Mac, or Linux machine or a machine on campus, instead.
   
2. **Familiarize yourself with Docker:**
   - [Docker Tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)

## Tasks 

### 0. Create Your First Docker Image
To create a Docker image, you will need to utilize a Dockerfile. Create a Dockerfile that:

- Is based on the latest ubuntu
- Update APT using apt-get update
- Upgrade currently installed software through APT using apt-get upgrade -y
- Once built, you can run the Docker image in a container and it will echo “Hello, World!” on the terminal.
Example (your output may look different depending on your local environment and whether or not you have cached data):

- Directory: task0

### 1. Back-end

For this task, start by making a copy of your `task0` directory and name it `task1`. Next, we want to change the `Dockerfile` to install Python3, pip3, and Flask. You may not have used Flask, yet, but not to worry; for this project, we will give you all of the Flask code you need to get started. We’ll validate that all have been installed correctly by running a Flask server with one endpoint that when called returns “Hello, World!”

Install `python3, python3-pip`, and `flask`
Note: Make sure to automatically install and skip user input with the `-y` flag for `apt-get`
Note: flask must be installed with `pip3`, not through apt-get
If you get a `This environment is externally managed` error when trying to install Python packages, add the following line before calling `pip` on your `Dockerfile`

`RUN rm /usr/lib/python*/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`

Locally, create a Python file named `api.py` and paste the following Python script - it uses Flask to create one endpoint that returns “Hello, World!” when called
Hosting this Flask app on `0.0.0.0 `instead of `127.0.0.1` means that it is reachable outside of the current machine (the current machine being a Docker container which is running inside of your laptop/desktop)
Host this Flask app on port 5252

### api.py
```bash
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/hello')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5252)
```

- In your `Dockerfile`, use `/app` as the working directory and copy the Python file to your Docker image
- When running your Docker image, your Flask server should spin up and accept requests
You will need to make sure that you forward the Docker container’s port 5252 to the host machine’s port 5252 when running your image in a container.
- Example (your output may look different depending on your local environment and whether or not you have cached data):

 - Directory: `task1`

### 2. Front-end

For this task, start by making a copy of your `task1` directory and name it `task2`. We have created a very simple API server with one route that returns “Hello, World!” and now we want to create a web page to view content from our API server in the context of a more full front-end. Before creating our front end, let’s reorganize this project a bit in our `task2` directory.

- Create a new directory named `back-end` inside of your `task2` directory.
- Move all of the files currently in `task2` inside of the new `back-end` directory.
__You should have `api.py` and `Dockerfile` inside of your new `task2/back-end directory.`__

- Create a new `task2/front-end` directory
- Inside your new `task2/front-end`, clone this repository -> [link](https://github.com/atlas-school/softy-pinko-front-end)

With the `softy-pinko-front-end` directory and files in place, we need to create a new `Dockerfile` in your `task2/front-end` directory. In order to host and distribute our front-end content we will use a static web server named [Nginx](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/PtxALAzljP8pkMygn-j7dw); there are many others that can be used, but this one is rather simple to get started with and conveniently has a Docker image that we can use which is pre-installed.

- In the new `task2/front-end/Dockerfile`, instead of using the latest ubuntu version, use the latest version of `nginx`.
- Your `softy-pinko-front-end` files must be copied to `/var/www/html/softy-pinko-front-end` on the Docker image.
- Create an Nginx config file named `softy-pinko-front-end.conf` inside of the `task2/front-end` directory. This file must be copied to the Docker image to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` and must include all of the configuration settings required to get your site to show up when visiting the URL.

__When researching Nginx config files, the only section you’ll need in the `softy-pinko-front-end.conf` file is the “server” section. Pay attention to the syntax used to set up a port to listen to (recommendation: port 9000), the name of the server, the location, and the index file to use.__

__softy-pinko-front-end.conf__

```bash
server {
// Replace with your Nginx server configuration
}
```

At the end of this process, you should have a front end that is accessible like the following:

### 3. Connecting the Front-end and Back-end

To start this task, make a copy of your `task2 `directory and name it `task3`.

This task will have you connect your front-end to the back-end allowing you to have dynamic data on your front-end. This means that communication will occur between your two Docker images (each of which will be running in their own Docker container). To facilitate this, be sure to have multiple terminal instances open so you can have one Docker container running on each.

First thing we should do is prepare the front-end. We need to add a couple of things:

__New HTML to add__

```<h1 id="dynamic-content"></h1>```

This needs to be added before the `<h1>` that includes the text “We provide the best strategy to grow up your business”.

__index.html__

```bash
// . . . SOME HTML BEFORE . . . 
<div class="offset-xl-3 col-xl-6 offset-lg-2 col-lg-8 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
    <h1 id="dynamic-content"></h1>
    <h1>We provide the best <strong>strategy</strong><br>to grow up your<strong>business</strong></h1>
    <a href="#features" class="main-button-slider">Discover More</a>
</div>
// . . . SOME HTML AFTER . . . 
```
This new `<h1>` tag with the ID of `dynamic-content` is the place we’re going to insert dynamic data from our API server.

Now we need to actually use some JavaScript code to make the request. Place the following script near the bottom of the HTML as the last `<script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag.

__Add this script to your index.html__

```bash
<script>
    // Load dynamic data from the back-end on port 5252
    $(function() {
        $.ajax({
            type: "GET",
            url: "http://localhost:5252/api/hello",
            success: function(data) {
                console.log(data);
                $('#dynamic-content').text(data);
            }
        });
    });
</script>
```

That is all the front-end needs to be able to connect to the back-end, however there is one more thing we must do to our back-end so that it can accept cross-origin requests from our front-end. We must use the CORS plugin for Flask.

In your back-end’s `back-end/Dockerfile`, use `pip3` to install `flask-cors` after you have installed `flask` through `pip3`. Next, use this updated python script as your `api.py`.

__api.py__
```bash
from flask import Flask
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route('/api/hello')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5252)
```

Now, your back-end will allow your front-end to communicate with it even though they are not on the same server (they are on two different Docker containers).

It should look like this:

### 4. Making it Simpler with Docker Compose

Having separate Docker images/containers per component of your application can reduce the complexity of your web apps. That said, having more than a single Docker image that you need to spin up in containers can present challenges; what if you need to spin up 3 distinct Docker images, or 7, or 50? Opening each one, one at a time would quickly become an issue. That’s where Docker Compose comes into play. With a `docker-compose.yml` file, we can specify the different components of your entire application, set up some basic configurations, and allow Docker to handle spinning up the entire application all at once, no matter how many containers there are.

Before going further, be sure to copy the task3 directory and name it task4.

Inside the task4 directory, create a `docker-compose.yml` file

Once you’ve set up your `docker-compose.yml` file with the correct services, you should be able to build them using `docker-compose build` and run it with `docker-compose up` like this:

Important keywords to have in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

services
build, context, dockerfile
image
ports
Note: when setting a port, the syntax will be HOSTPORT:CONTAINERPORT. For example, `9999:4567` would map the 4567 port inside of the Docker container to the host machine’s 9999 port. If you only supply one port number, instead of a mapping, you are only specifying an internal port that other Docker containers can reach, but they will not be mapped to any port on the host machine. If you do not map any ports, you will not be able to get past the firewall that Docker has put up. Docker uses something similar to Linux’s Uncomplicated Firewall ufw; you do not directly work with this firewall, but instead, map allowed ports in Dockerfiles or docker-compose files to allow/disallow access through certain ports.

### 5. Proxy Server

So far we’ve created a static server and one API server, each of which has its own Docker images and runs in different Docker containers. This is okay, but this means that we have to keep track of two separate locations. If we change the port that the API server is using, then we’d have to change the client to hit that new port; in this case ports on our computer, but it would be IP addresses if these were external servers. This is not ideal, especially if you have many different clients that you’d need to update and deploy.

Instead, let’s put a server in front of our static server and API server that acts as a proxy between the client and our full application. Clients (in this case the web browser) will only have to know about the proxy server’s location and our front-end can also simply hit the same proxy server, rather than going to the API directly, to then be routed to the API server in order to get dynamic data from it.

Before going further, copy the `task4` directory and name it `task5`. In the `task5` directory, create a new folder named `proxy`.

Just like with our static-content server, we’re going to use Nginx for this proxy server. In your proxy directory, create a Dockerfile that uses the latest version of nginx. Also, create a file named proxy.conf, which will contain all of the configuration for your `proxy` server. In the `Dockerfile`, make sure to copy the `proxy.conf` file to this specific location in your Docker image for the proxy server: `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`.

For the `proxy.conf` file, the only section you’ll need in the `proxy.conf` file is the “server” section. You want this proxy server to be listening to port 80. Set up a `location` section for / and use `proxy_pass` to route any request coming in on that route to `http://INSERT-YOUR-FRONT-END-DOCKER-COMPOSE-SERVICE-NAME-HERE:9000.` Next, set up a `location` section for `/api` and use `proxy_pass` to route any request coming in on that route to `http://INSERT-YOUR-BACK-END-DOCKER-COMPOSE-SERVICE-NAME-HERE:5252.`

__proxy.conf__

```
server {
    // Replace with your Nginx server configuration
}
```

Note that you are using the same service name that you used in your `docker-compose.yml` file for the front and back ends. This is because Docker has an internal DNS that will setup routes to internal IP addresses for those names. This is a bit of “magic” that Docker does, but it makes it super convenient to not have to know the exact IP addresses of these services.

Another thing that needs to be modified is the JavaScript that is used. It was previously calling the back-end server directly; instead, we want to have the JavaScript make an API call through the proxy server as well. Replace your JavaScript at the bottom of the `index.html` file with the following:

__JavaScript At Bottom Of index.html__

```
<script>
    // Load dynamic data from the back-end on port 5252
    $(function() {
        $.ajax({
            type: "GET",
            url: "/api/hello",
            success: function (data) {
                console.log(data);
                $('#dynamic-content').text(data);
            }
        });
    });
</script>
```

Next, we need to update the `docker-compose.yml` file to add a new service named `proxy`. Be sure to include the same sections as previously used: * build, context, dockerfile * image * ports * Map the container’s port 80 to the host machine’s port 80. * Note: You should remove the mapping for the front-end and back-end service to the host machine ports. You will want to have port 5252 and port 9000 open internally on the containers so that other Docker containers can reach them, but you do not want external clients reaching out directly to the front-end or the back-end; everything should go through the proxy server. If you do not map any ports, you will not be able to get past the firewall that Docker has put up. Docker uses something similar to Linux’s Uncomplicated Firewall ufw; you do not directly work with this firewall, but instead, map allowed ports in Dockerfiles or docker-compose files to allow/disallow access through certain ports. depends_on

The following image shows the browser hitting `http://localhost:80`, which is the proxy server.

Next, notice that you cannot access the front-end or back-end servers directly - you can only reach your services by going through the proxy server.

### 6. Scale Horizontally

Congratulations! You’ve got a proxy server that routes to either a static-content server or to an API server for dynamic data. This works well, for now…but what would happen if traffic to your site spiked up dramatically to where your API server becomes too flooded with requests to be able to respond quickly? In this case, we would like to add a second API server and load-balance all requests between those two servers. Luckily, with Nginx and Docker, this is a simple flag when running `docker-compose up`!

For this task, make a copy of the `task5` directory and name it `task6`. Your goal is to launch your Docker containers such that you have 2 (or more) API servers. Nginx will act as a load-balance between them so that every request goes to the next API server using the Round-Robin load-balancing algorithm.

Create a new file in the `task6` directory named `2-api-servers.txt` and put in the exact docker-compose command used to spin up two API servers, instead of just one. Note: for this task, the checker will assume that you named your back-end server `back-end` and your file must end with a newline Your output should look like this:
